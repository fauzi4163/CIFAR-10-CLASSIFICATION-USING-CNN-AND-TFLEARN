This repository contains three file TRlearnDNN.py that is the model designed for classification, the file TrainDNN.py is a file that is for
training the model on the training dataset of CIFAR-10, the third file is Predict.py that is for predicting classes for the test data of
CIFAR-10.
CIFAR-10 training and test data sets are not included but they are freely available online. They can be downloaded in local directories and can be used in the codes accordingly.
